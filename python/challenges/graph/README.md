# Graph:
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- add node
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: The added node
    - Add a node to the graph
- add edge
    - Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
    - If specified, assign a weight to the edge
    - Both nodes should already be in the Graph


### Challenge:
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Node can be successfully added to the graph
- An edge can be successfully added to the graph
- A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
- All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph

### Approach & Efficiency:
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Space complexity O(1)
- Time complexity O(1)
