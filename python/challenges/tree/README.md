# Tree:
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called pre_order, in_order, and post_order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

### Challenge:
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left node, and the right node. Also create a BinaryTree class.

### Approach & Efficiency:
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- 

### Solution:
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
- in_order => log(n)
- pre_order => log(n)
- post_order => log(n)
