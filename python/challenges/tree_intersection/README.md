# Tree_intersection:
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
-  Binary Trees can be in many shapes but are most useful when balanced. Walking Binary Trees in depth-first order is done the same as walking Binary Search Trees which can be done in pre-order, in-order or post-order. Binary Trees, like Binary Search Trees, can also be walked in depth-first order

### Approach & Efficiency:
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
