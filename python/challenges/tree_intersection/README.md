# Tree_intersection:
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called pre_order, in_order, and post_order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

### Challenge:
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left node, and the right node. Also create a BinaryTree class.
